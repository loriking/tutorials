Here are some cases where your program will have problem:

- your user is a greek from the antiquity. His birth year is '-234'
- your user is from the far futur, his birth year is '23498345'
- your user doesn't type very well and has typed '199O' with a O instead of a 0
- your user has written his birth year in letter! 'nineteen seventythree'
- your user is a hacker and he tried a list of strange characters for his birth year 'Ã‡*@\n'
